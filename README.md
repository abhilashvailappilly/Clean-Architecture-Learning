# Clean Architecture Learning with Product Crud operation as an Example

## Overview
This project serves as a learning resource for understanding the principles of Clean Architecture through the lens of a simple product management system. Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns and independence of frameworks, allowing for more flexible and maintainable software systems.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Basic CRUD operations for managing products.
- **Clean Architecture Structure**: The project is organized following the principles of Clean Architecture, with clear separation of concerns between layers.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies are inverted to ensure high-level policies are independent of low-level implementations.
<!-- - **Testability**: Components are designed to be easily testable, promoting a test-driven development approach. -->

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: TypeScript,Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDb

## Getting Started
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using [dependency manager].
3. **Configuration**: Set up the database connection and any other environment configurations.
4. **Run**: **Npm start** Start the application.
5. **Explore**: Navigate through the codebase to understand the Clean Architecture structure and how different layers interact.
